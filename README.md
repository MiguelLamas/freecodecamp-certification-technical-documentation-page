Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

For this project I am using HTML and CSS to build a Technical Documentation Page to serve as a reference and introduction to JavaScript Fundamentals.
